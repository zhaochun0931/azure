Azure Database for MySQL flexible server is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud based on the MySQL Community Edition







Azure Database for MySQL powered by the MySQL community edition is available in two deployment modes:
--- Flexible Server
--- Single Server


Azure Database for MySQL single server is on the retirement path. We strongly recommend that you upgrade to Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.
