Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. 
Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port.




Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. 
So if /images is in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. 
If /video is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos.
