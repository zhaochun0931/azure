Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers or resources.




Azure Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's the single point of contact for clients. 
Load balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances. 
These flows are according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. 
The backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Set.




Azure Load Balancer includes a few key components.
